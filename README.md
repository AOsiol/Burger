# Burger Heaven

This is a great application that explores Mysql, Express, Handlebars and ORM. Here we are able to create a burger by naming it, deciding if it is eaten or not and clicking on the submit button. At this point the ORM is responsible for sending the info to the database where is is then sent back to the html page and handlebars displays it to the web page.
